    <h2>PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>I'm an inquisitive and quick-learner Computer Science student with practical experience in various fields—IT support, tower infrastructure, and training coordination—acquired through telecommunications internships. I find joy working on actual issues, be it creating websites, explaining technical ideas to people, or conducting productive training sessions. I'm particularly interested in frontend development, data analysis, and product design. I work well in teams, communicate effectively, and learn fast when faced with new challenges. I'm currently searching for an entry-level position or internship where I can continue learning, make valuable contributions, and develop into the tech professional I'm striving to be.</p>
